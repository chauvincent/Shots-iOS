Shots!
===================


Hey, this is just a fun challenge using the Kamcord API to retrieve featured feed and play short snapshot videos when tapped on a collection view cell. Written in Objective-C.

Random Remarks:
-------------

It has been awhile since I have used a collectionview. This was overall a very fun project using Kamcord's Feed API. I also haven't tried playing videos on iOS apps until today and it took less lines of code than I thought it would.
